Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes. The file can be used to create and start all the services from your configuration with a single command. This tool allows you to define and manage the entire lifecycle of your application, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications in a consistent environment.
* Docker Compose is used for:

    * Defining and running multi-container Docker applications
    * Simplifying the management of application services and their dependencies.
    * Improving the organization and scaling of applications by allowing for definition and versioning of configurations.
