    * git doesnâ€™t identify an empty folder as a change. only the folders with files are considered as changes
* `git add .` adding the files

    * Deleting a tracked file is considered as change.

    * Once git create a commit, it gives a commit id.![Image](./Images/git3.png)
    * When we add new changes and commit the changes the latest commit will be child of previous commit or previous commit is parent of latest commit
* `git log` displays all of the commits in a repository's history 

    * `git log --oneline` to display 

        * one commit per line
        * the first seven characters of the SHA
        * the commit message
    *  `git log --stat` used to display

        * the files that were modified in each commit
        * the number of lines added or removed
        * a summary line with the total number of files and lines changed
