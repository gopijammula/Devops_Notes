`git stash` is a Git command that allows you to temporarily save changes that have not been committed to a stash, so that you can switch to a different branch or work on something else without losing the changes. The stashed changes can be reapplied later on when you are ready to work on them again.
* The stash is a special commit-like object that stores the changes you made to your working tree and index. This makes it possible to switch between branches, pull in changes from remote repositories, or do other tasks without committing the changes you've made to your current branch.
## Example usage:
* Start by making some changes to your working tree and index, but don't commit them.
* Run the following command to stash your changes:

        git stash
* Now, you can switch to a different branch, pull in changes from a remote repository, or do other tasks that require a clean working tree and index.
* To reapply the stashed changes, switch back to the original branch and run the following command:

        git stash apply
* This will restore the changes you made to your working tree and index. You can also use `git stash pop` to reapply the stashed changes and remove the stash from the stash list.
