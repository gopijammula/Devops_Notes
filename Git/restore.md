`git restore` is a Git command that allows you to undo changes to the working tree and index. The git restore command can be used to restore specific files, or to restore the entire repository to a specific commit.
## Example:
* To restore a specific file to its state at the latest commit, run the following command:

        git restore <file>
* To restore a file to its state at a specific commit, use the --source option and specify the commit ID:

        git restore --source <commit-id> <file-name>
* To reset the entire repository to a specific commit, you can use the git reset command with the --hard option:

        git reset --hard <commit>
This will reset the repository to the specified commit, discarding all changes that have been made since that commit.
* Note: It's important to use these commands with caution, as they can permanently destroy data in your repository. Make sure to backup your repository before using `git restore` or `git reset` if you're not sure how they work.
