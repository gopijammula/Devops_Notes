* `git fetch` is a Git command used to download data from a remote repository. 
* It retrieves data, including branches and tags, from the source repository, but it doesn't automatically merge the data into your local repository. 
* The purpose of git fetch is to update your local branch references and to provide you with a complete and current view of the remote repository. This allows you to see what changes have taken place in the remote repository, compare them with your local repository, and decide whether or not you want to integrate those changes into your local repository using git merge or git rebase.
* Run the following command to fetch data from the remote repository:

         `git fetch origin`
* Here, origin is the name of the remote repository. This command retrieves all the branches and tags from the remote repository
