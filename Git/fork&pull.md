## Pull:
To "pull" in Git means to download the latest version of a repository from a remote source (such as Github) and merge it with your local copy. This allows you to keep your local version of the code up-to-date with the remote version. To perform a pull, use the command "git pull origin [branch-name]". Replace "[branch-name]" with the name of the branch you want to update.
