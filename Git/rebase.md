`git rebase` is a Git command that modifies the existing commit history by "replaying" changes from a series of commits onto a different base branch. It is used to simplify a complex branch history, avoid merge conflicts, and maintain a linear project history. Rebase can be used to reapply changes from a feature branch onto the latest version of the base branch, but it should be used with caution as it can rewrite the commit history and cause conflicts if other people have already pulled the original commits.
