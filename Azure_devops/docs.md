Azure DevOps is a set of development tools provided by Microsoft that helps software development teams to plan, develop, test, and deploy software efficiently. It provides a complete suite of tools that allow developers and project managers to collaborate, automate builds and releases, track work items and issues, and monitor performance.

Azure DevOps includes the following services:

* Azure Boards: A flexible, powerful work tracking system for agile teams.
* Azure Repos: A Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repository for source control.
* Azure Test Plans: A comprehensive, web-based test management solution for manual and automated testing.
* Azure Artifacts: A package management system for managing packages and dependencies.
* Azure DevOps also provides integration with popular third-party tools and services such as GitHub, Jenkins, and Slack.

By using Azure DevOps, development teams can collaborate and deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently. The platform also allows teams to manage their entire application lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and monitoring, in one place.

## Azure repos:
Azure Repos is a source control management system provided by Microsoft as a part of Azure DevOps. It allows developers to manage and store their source code in a centralized repository, collaborate with team members, and track changes to the codebase.

Azure Repos supports two types of version control systems: Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to work offline and synchronize changes later. TFVC is a centralized version control system that uses a client-server architecture.

With Azure Repos, developers can:

* Store and version control their code in a centralized repository
* Collaborate with team members by reviewing and merging changes
* Use branches and pull requests to isolate and manage changes to the codebase
* Automate builds and deployments with Azure Pipelines
* Integrate with popular development tools like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

Azure Repos provides a secure, scalable, and highly available platform for managing source code and enables teams to work more efficiently and collaboratively.

## Azure Pipeline:
Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) service provided by Microsoft as a part of Azure DevOps. It allows developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their applications across multiple platforms and environments.

Azure Pipelines supports multiple languages and platforms, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and many others. It provides a flexible and customizable pipeline that allows developers to define their build, test, and deployment stages. Developers can use pre-built tasks and templates or create their custom tasks using PowerShell, Bash, or any other scripting language.

With Azure Pipelines, developers can:

* Automate the build and testing process for their applications
* Deploy applications to multiple environments, including on-premises, Azure, and third-party cloud providers.
* Integrate with other Azure DevOps services, such as Azure Repos, Azure Test Plans, and Azure Artifacts.
* Monitor and analyze application performance using built-in analytics and monitoring tools.

Azure Pipelines provides a secure, reliable, and scalable platform for automating the software development process, reducing time-to-market, and improving the quality of software releases. It also integrates with popular third-party tools like GitHub, Jira, and Slack.

In Azure we have two types of pipelines :

1. Build Pipeline
2. Release Pipeline 

## difference between build pipeline and release pipeline 
Build pipelines and release pipelines are two types of pipelines in Azure DevOps that serve different purposes in the software delivery process.

A build pipeline is responsible for compiling, testing, and packaging the source code into a deployable artifact. It starts with the code repository, runs a series of build tasks, and produces an artifact that can be used for deployment. The primary goal of a build pipeline is to validate the quality of the code and ensure that it's in a releasable state.

On the other hand, a release pipeline is responsible for deploying the artifact produced by the build pipeline to different environments. It starts with the artifact produced by the build pipeline and runs a series of deployment tasks to deliver the application to end-users. The primary goal of a release pipeline is to deliver the code changes to users quickly, safely, and consistently.

Here are some differences between build pipeline and release pipeline in Azure DevOps:

In summary, build pipelines and release pipelines are both critical components of a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) process. While build pipelines focus on compiling, testing, and packaging source code into a deployable artifact, release pipelines focus on delivering the artifact to users safely and consistently.

## Azure Test Plans:
Azure Test Plans is a service provided by Microsoft Azure DevOps that enables teams to plan, track, and test their applications across different platforms and devices. It provides a set of tools for manual and automated testing, including test plans, test suites, test cases, and test results management.

Azure Test Plans can be used to:

* Create and manage test plans: Teams can create test plans that define the scope of testing, test environments, and test configurations.

* Create and manage test suites: Test suites help organize test cases and can be used to group tests by functionality, priority, or other criteria.

* Create and manage test cases: Test cases define the steps to follow and the expected results for each test.

* Run manual tests: Manual tests can be performed using Azure Test Plans, and the results can be recorded and tracked in the tool.

* Run automated tests: Teams can use Azure Test Plans to run automated tests, including unit tests, functional tests, and performance tests.

* Analyze test results: Azure Test Plans provides reports and dashboards to analyze test results, including test pass rates, code coverage, and test duration.

* Azure Test Plans integrates with other Azure DevOps services, including Azure Boards and Azure Repos, allowing teams to manage their entire software development process from one platform. It also supports integration with popular third-party testing tools like Selenium, JUnit, and NUnit.

In summary, Azure Test Plans is a comprehensive testing solution that enables teams to plan, track, and test their applications effectively. It provides tools for manual and automated testing, test case management, and reporting, helping teams ensure high-quality software releases.
